### Minor Changes

- 6d64d72: feat(coach): main-lift PRs across SDK, MCP, and CLI + shared db package

  A coach can pull every roster athlete's personal records for the main barbell lifts (squat,
  bench, deadlift, overhead press, clean & jerk, snatch) in one call. Resolution is
  discovery-driven: it reads what each athlete actually logged (the program-workout range, not the
  monthly calendar summary, which comes back empty for some accounts) and buckets the real variant
  they train — so "Back Squat", "Goblet Squat", "Incline DB Bench Press", or "Shoulder Press" land
  in the right family instead of a naive name lookup hitting an empty library entry.

  Surfaces: the `fetchAthleteMainLiftPRs` / `fetchRosterMainLiftPRs` / `classifyMainLift` SDK calls
  (plus `fetchCoachRoster`), the `athlete_main_lift_prs` and `roster_main_lift_prs` MCP tools (local
  coach server and hosted worker), and the `coach main-lift-prs [--athlete | --athletes | --months]`
  CLI command. `presentExerciseHistory` now carries each PR's units.

  Also extracts the Drizzle warehouse layer into a new `@trainheroic-unofficial/db` package shared
  by the worker and any local tool, with two adapters: `db/d1` (Cloudflare D1) and `db/sqlite`
  (Node's built-in `node:sqlite`). The one driver-specific operation, atomic batch, is injected as a
  `BatchExec` (D1 `batch()` vs sqlite `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`), so one store body runs on both. The worker
  now consumes this package; its behaviour is unchanged. Migrations are single-sourced in the db
  package (wrangler reads them there) and embedded so the `db/sqlite` `applyMigrations` runner brings
  a local SQLite database up to schema. A `CoachAthletePrStore` syncs the roster PR board into either
  warehouse.
