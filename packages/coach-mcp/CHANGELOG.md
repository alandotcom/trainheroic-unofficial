### Minor Changes

- 72bd48b: feat(coach): prescribe reps/weight for one athlete without marking the set done

  Adds a per-athlete prescription override: a coach can set the prescribed reps and/or weight on
  one of a roster athlete's scheduled sets, for that athlete only, leaving the set open (not marked
  performed) and the team/program prescription untouched. This is the API equivalent of editing an
  athlete's prescribed values in the app, and writes to the same `savedworkoutsetexercise` endpoint
  as logging but with every `param_N_made`/`completed` flag left at 0.

  Surfaces: the `prescribeForAthlete` SDK call, the `prescribe_athlete_set` MCP tool, and the
  `coach prescribe-set` CLI command. param1 is reps, param2 is weight; the write replaces the slot's
  prescribed values. Use `log_athlete_set` / `coach log-set` instead to record a set as performed.

  The internal `buildExerciseLogPayload` helper was generalized and renamed to
  `buildExerciseSetPayload`, taking a `markPerformed` flag that selects logging vs. prescribing.

- f41ac54: feat(coach): swap one exercise in a roster athlete's prescribed workout

  Adds a per-athlete exercise swap: a coach can replace one exercise in an athlete's scheduled
  team/program workout with a different one, for that athlete only, leaving the team prescription
  untouched. The new exercise carries over the slot's prescribed sets.

  Surfaces: the `swapAthleteExercise` SDK call, the `swap_athlete_exercise` MCP tool (coach
  surface, confirmation-gated), and the `coach swap-exercise --set-exercise <id> --exercise <id>
--yes` CLI command. The slot id comes from `athlete_saved_workouts` / `coach athlete-workouts
--log-ids`; the replacement exercise from `exercise_resolve` / `exercise_search`. Backed by
  `PUT /v5/savedWorkoutSetExercises/{id}?exerciseId=`; seeded demo athletes are read-only.

### Patch Changes

- 0f99401: fix(cloudflare): make hosted login and open-registration copy role-neutral

  Athletes authenticate through the same OAuth flow as coaches, but the consent page, the
  DEPLOY.md open-registration note, and the open-registration warning all framed it as
  coach-only. They now say "account" (coach or athlete) instead.

### Minor Changes

- dbe2c63: Replace the raw `th_request` escape hatch with typed tools so the model never has to guess endpoints. Adds athlete `invite`/`archive`/`restore`, team `create`/`update`/`delete` and join-code create/delete, an `analytics_query` tool covering readiness, 1RM and working-max history, training summary, compliance, and lift progress, and session `unpublish`/`copy`/`save_as_template`. Destructive and athlete-facing actions still gate through `confirmGate`; additive writes are ungated. Request shapes were verified against the live TrainHeroic API.
