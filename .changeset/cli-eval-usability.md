fix(cli,js): eval-driven usability fixes for the coach/athlete write surface. `log-set`'s "set not found on this date" error now lists the `savedWorkoutSetId`s and exercise ids actually present on that date (the dominant Haiku confusion — agents could not tell which raw id maps to `--set`), and a coach write that 401s now names the demo/seeded read-only cause. New `--log-ids` projection on `coach athlete-workouts` / `athlete workouts` (`presentLogTargets` in `js`) prints just the `savedWorkoutSetId` + `savedWorkoutSetExerciseId` log-set needs, instead of grepping the full `--raw` payload. `coach athlete-workouts` gains `--logged-only`/`--summary` (parity with `athlete workouts`); `analytics-query` with no `--metric` prints a metric catalog (scope + required params) via `analyticsMetricCatalog`, and HELP signposts that team training volume lives in `roster-activity --metric`. Empty `athlete-training`/`athlete-lift-history` results carry an explanatory note, and the help text frames the three athlete-data reads as distinct lenses. Drove mean Haiku confusion from 2.45 to ~1.7 (see `docs/cli-evals/2026-06-21.md`).
